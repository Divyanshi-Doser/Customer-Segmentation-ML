# Customer-Segmentation-ML

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers into meaningful groups based on their demographics, spending behavior, and loyalty.  
The segmentation is achieved using **K-Means Clustering** and visualized with PCA.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (KMeans, PCA, StandardScaler)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains:
- Customer ID, Age, Gender
- Annual Income, Spending Score
- Purchase Frequency, Loyalty Membership
- Years as Customer

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Encoding & Scaling
3. K-Means Clustering (Elbow + Silhouette method)
4. PCA Visualization
5. Cluster Profiling & Insights

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Cluster 0:** Mature & Loyal Customers (long tenure, steady spenders)
- **Cluster 1:** Mature but At-Risk Customers (low loyalty, moderate spenders)
- **Cluster 2:** Young, Trend-Driven Customers (low income, high spending, high frequency)

## 💡 Recommendations
- Retain loyal customers with exclusive benefits.
- Re-engage at-risk customers with personalized offers.
- Target young high-spenders with flash sales & trendy campaigns.
